# Single-Cycle MIPS System Verilog Implemenation
This repository contains the System Verilog code for a Single-Cycle Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages (MIPS) that implements the Fibonacci sequence. 

## Description
This final project was developed for University of Washington's EEP 599 Digital Design with FPGAs and references "Digital Design and Computer Architecture, Second Edition" by David Money Harris and Sarah L. Harris. 

The goal of this final project was to load a MIPS onto an FPGA board and run the Fibonacci sequence using Assembly/Machine code. 

## Hardware and Simulation
The SV code was simulated using Modelsim and was tested/verified on an Intel DE1_SoC FPGA board.
